Alexander Li Cohen is a child neurologist and physician-scientist specializing in using translational neuroimaging to understand and treat Autism Spectrum Disorders and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Following his undergraduate and MD/PhD training at Washington University in St. Louis, he completed residency in Pediatrics and Child Neurology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN during which he developed an interest in childhood conditions affecting cognition including Autism Spectrum Disorders. Dr. Cohen went on to complete a Pediatric Behavioral Neurology fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital and a post-doctoral research fellowship in the Computational Radiology Laboratory at BCH and the Laboratory for Brain Network Imaging and Modulation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He now cares for patients in the Autism Spectrum Center and Behavioral Neurology Clinic and is starting his own Laboratory of Translational Neuroimaging as part of the new multidisciplinary Brain, Mind, and Behavior Center at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Dr. Cohen’s research interests and expertise include constructing and applying novel neuroimaging methods to understand brain development, with a focus on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, i.e., disorders that affect wide-ranging networks in the brain. He is most well-known for work using non-invasive functional MRI to describe functional areas and networks across the brain. Now, in collaboration with the Center of Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dr. Cohen focuses on localizing the neuroanatomy for specific symptoms seen in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as impairment of face recognition or infantile spasms, using network neuroimaging techniques that apply insight gained from one patient population to another, i.e., “bedside-to-beside” translation, to generate treatment targets for clinical trials of non-invasive neuromodulation using TMS, tDCS, and real-time fMRI neurofeedback.
